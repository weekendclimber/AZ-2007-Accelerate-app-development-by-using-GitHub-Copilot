# Prepare the Sample Applications for AZ-2007 instructor demonstrations

## Instructions

### Prepare sample apps in your Visual Studio Code environment

The modules in this course include GitHub Copilot instructor demonstration activities. Most of the demonstrations use a prepared code sample as a starting point for the activity.

The demo activities are designed for an environment that includes the following resources:

- Visual Studio Code.
- The C# Dev Kit extension for Visual Studio Code.
- The GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions for Visual Studio Code. A GitHub account with an active subscription for GitHub Copilot is required.
- Sample code projects created using C#.

**NOTE**: We recommend that instructors consider using their own GitHub account and GitHub Copilot subscription for the demos. This will enable you to control and customize your dev environment. It will also make it easier to adjust the demos to fit the needs of your classrooms.

**IMPORTANT**: If you choose to run the demos in the hosted lab environment rather than your instructor PC, you can unzip the sample apps in the hosted environment. You will need to configure the GitHub Copilot extensions in the hosted environment before you can run the demos. You may find that the hosted environment is slower than your local environment, so you may need to adjust the pace of the demos accordingly.

To prepare for the demos, complete the following steps in your chosen dev environment:

1. To download a zip file containing the sample apps, open the following link: [SampleApps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/APL-2007-Accelerate-app-development-by-using-GitHub-Copilot/master/LearnModuleExercises/Downloads/SampleApps.zip).

    The zip file should download automatically.

1. Unzip the downloaded SampleApps file.

    Unzip the files in your development environment.

    1. On your local machine, navigate to your downloads folder.
    1. Right-click **SampleApps.zip**, and then select **Extract all**.
    1. Select **Show extracted files when complete**, and then select **Extract**.

1. Copy the extracted **SampleApps** folder to your Windows Desktop folder.

    The **SampleApps** folder contains the sample app projects used in the course demos. Each project is in it's own folder. The demo instructions indicate which project to open for that demo.

1. Practice each of the 12 instructor demonstrations before teaching the class.

    This will help you become familiar with the content and the steps required to complete the activities.
